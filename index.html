                                <p>The project was made dugin the full third year of university, this included the research report as well as the design of the artefact. The artefact itself, however, started development in January of 2020 and completed development in May 2020.</p>
                                <p>The main focus of the game was to create a game that could be played by those with motor impairments, specifically those with the most extreme cases, which meant creating a game that could be played with only a single input, such as a button, a microphone or camera. Other impairment support such as hearing or vision impairments were added to the artefact but were not the main focus. The genre of the game was puzzle.</p>
                                <p>The player follows a set track and the puzzles start automatically once the player arrives to a specific point. This was the third revision of the game and originally the vision was of a more complex type of puzzle game similar to that of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Portal 2</a>. The reason for this change was because of the inability to find suitable controls for the player movement.</p>

                                <p>This tower defence game was made during the second year of university. The assignment was given with the only instruction being that it had to be a tower defence game. I took that prompt and made this game using Unreal Engine 4, C++, and blueprints.</p>
                                <p>The main mechanic of this game is that the player takes control of a pawn on the screen that can move around outside of the grid, but can only place defence units on the grid itself. The player also defines the start and end of the enemie's path.</p>
                                <p>After an enemy unit dies, it has the chance to spawn smaller enemy units that chase after the player, who can then shoot bullets at them to defend themselves. The main reason for including this mechanic is that the player would now have something to do while their tower is being defended.</p>

                                <p>This rhythm-based runner game was made in Unity and C#. The game was made with the intention of it being played on mobile devices, and so features a portrait game screen and simple swipe controls.</p>
                                <p>The game style is made to resemble the vaporwave, synthwave and retrowave music genres. This means that all the in-game music and art style, being the player, obstacles, background and UI all fit with the theme.</p>
                                <p>Development for the game started in late November 2019, and completed development in March 2020. The video for the game was taken inside of the Unity editor and so the scene view is seen to the left of the gameplay.</p>

                                <p>A bullet hell game is a game that bombardes the player with endless waves of bullets for the player to dodge. Some bullet hell's (such as Binding Of Isaac) may not be endless but feature multiple rooms for the player to make their way through. The game that I made features endless waves.</p>
                                <p>This game was made during the first 6 weeks of the second year of university in the TGP (Technical Games Production) module, and was a project that I made by myself. It was made using Unreal Engine 4 with mostly C++ and some blueprints.</p>
                                <p>The game features 4 weapons to choose from; a single shot rifle, a triple barrel shotgun, a grenade launcher and rocket launcher. Each weapon gives the player a unique playstyle as they have different effects. For example, the shotgun pushes the player back a little so they have to be wary of what's behind them.</p>

                                <p>The tutorials simply taught us the basics of programming, and was not made using a game engine, but was made using C++, and Staffordshire University's own framework called S2D.</p>
                                <p>The goal of the game is to simply survive for as long as possible while trying to fend of infinitely spawning enemies.</p>
